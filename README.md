# Bad Ice Cream - DOPO 

## Intro 
This is a project built in 2025 for my POO class, made with Paula Valentina Lozano. 
Its purpose was to learn and improve Java and POO related topics, by implementing design patterns and code refactoring. 

## Gameplay
Bad Ice Cream is originally a FRIV Game where the player controls an ice cream character whose goal is to collect all fruits on the map
while avoiding enemies and obstacles. The game ends when all fruits are collected or the player is defeated.

### How to play 
Use the arrows for controlling Player #1 and and ASWD keys to control Player #2 given the case. The space bar is used to create and break ice blocks. 

## New features
Some of the differences that are shown from the original game was the game mode, where you could choose if you wanted to play or if a machine plays for you: 
For example, the types of machines include:
- Hungry: goes for the fruits no matter what.
- Fearful: tries to escape villains. 
- Expert: makes the smartest decision for the game situation. 

### Extra notes:
Some of the GIFs and sprites where found in the following link: https://www.spriters-resource.com/browser_games/badicecream/
Others where built and made from scratch. Same with backgrounds and buttons.
